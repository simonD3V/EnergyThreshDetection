# :signal_strength: BandwidthEstimation

Signal processing tool to estimate the maximum energy threshold of one or more audio files. 

Energy above a certain threshold may be lost due to compression manipulations (typically occurs when converting wav :arrow_right: mp3 :arrow_right: wav). This loss can be easily identified for a given sampling rate by examining the maximum frequency obtained for a percentage of the signal energy.  

* Example of _damaged_ signal :

![Damaged signal (10s long excerpt) ](/images/sig.png)
![Corresponding spectrogram (10s long excerpt) ](/images/spectrogram.png)

## PIP installation (in progress)
